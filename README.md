# What is this?
This repository is a collection of my solutions of the computing challenges given to me by my college.
There are 27 challenges in total, and I will be adding to this repository as I make my through the challenges.

## Why is this a repository?
My college uses replit for computer science, however replit has a limit of 10 hours of development time per month for the free version.
Because I don't feel like paying for a program I don't use for anything other than school, I thought I would develop outside of replit,
and only upload to replit when my college needs me to. 

# How can I run these programs?
Make sure you have all the required libraries (listed below) installed, then run the `main.py` file using the command:
```
python main.py
```
You will then be prompted to enter the challenge you want to access. For example, for challenge 27, you type in `27` when prompted and the code for that
problem will be ran. For problems 01-09, you do not need to type the leading zero as this is accounted for.

## Required repositories
Below is a list of required repositories
* math
* random
* os
* sys
* time
* csv

To install all of these at once, type the following into the shell:
```
pip install math random os sys time csv
```
